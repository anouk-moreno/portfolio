        <h2>Permwatch</h2>
        <p><em>Bachelor’s Thesis Project · Android Security Research</em></p>

        <p>
          Permwatch is an Android research application designed to study how users interact with application
          permissions and how their awareness of permission-related risks evolves over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system performs an on-device analysis of installed applications, focusing on both declared
          permissions and their granted state. Based on application usage frequency, users are asked daily
          questions about a small subset of their installed apps, covering high-, medium-, and low-usage
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over a seven-day period, the study guides users through short daily surveys covering a curated set
          of permissions selected based on prior research. Permwatch prioritizes permissions that belong to
          previously identified high-risk combinations, while still asking users about individual permissions
          to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the final day, users receive a personalized overview highlighting applications that contain
          potentially risky permission combinations, encouraging reflection on permission choices and their
          security implications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project integrates Android core APIs for application and usage analysis and uses Firebase
          Realtime Database for secure data collection throughout the study. Due to academic and privacy
          constraints, the source code is private.
        </p>

        <h3>Key characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Longitudinal, user-centric study design (7 days)</li>
          <li>Permission analysis based on real-world usage frequency</li>
          <li>Focus on risk emerging from permission combinations rather than individual permissions</li>
          <li>On-device data collection combined with cloud-based aggregation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Current status</h3>
        <p>Completed as part of a Bachelor’s thesis project.</p>

        <h3>Potential future improvements</h3>
        <p>
          Possible extensions include refining the existing codebase, extending the study duration to better
          capture long-term behavioral changes, and exploring privacy nudging techniques. Further improvements
          could focus on enhancing user-facing explanations of permission risks while maintaining a low
          cognitive load.
