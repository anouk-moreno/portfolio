      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Anouk. I studied Computer Science with a specialization in Statistics.
        Over the course of my studies, I was exposed to a wide range of topics related to
        software development, system behavior, and basic security concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would not describe myself as an expert in cybersecurity yet, but it is an area that
        has increasingly caught my attention, especially in relation to user privacy and
        real-world systems. At the same time, I am also interested in the financial domain and
        the challenges that arise when technology, data, and economics intersect.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my degree, I worked on applied projects that allowed me to explore these topics,
        including my Bachelor’s thesis, which focused on mobile permission analysis and user
        awareness through a longitudinal study. This project helped me understand how technical
        decisions, data collection, and user behavior interact in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am still in the process of defining my long-term professional path, but for now I am
        focusing on projects that combine cybersecurity with economically relevant systems.
        Further technical details about my work can be found in the other sections of this
        portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a more personal note, I plan to add access to my blog in the future, where I share
        reflections and interests beyond purely technical topics.
