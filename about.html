          <p>
            Hi, my name is Anouk. I studied Computer Science with a specialization in Statistics
            at LMU Munich, Germany. Throughout my degree, I was exposed to a wide range of topics
            related to software development, computer architecture, networks, linear models,
            and introductory concepts in cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would not say that I have deep expertise in cybersecurity yet. However, it is an
            area that has gradually captured my interest, particularly when applied to user
            security and real-world systems. At the same time, I am also interested in finance
            and in problems that lie at the intersection of technology, data, and economics.
            For this reason, I am currently exploring challenges that combine these domains and
            trying to understand how they interact in practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on applied projects, including my
            Bachelor’s thesis, which focused on user awareness and mobile permission analysis
            through a longitudinal study. While this project leaned more towards
            human–computer interaction than I initially expected, it helped me understand how
            small technical decisions, data collection choices, and human behavior can
            significantly affect real-world outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am still at an early stage in defining my long-term professional direction, but
            for now I am focusing on building projects that allow me to explore both
            cybersecurity-related topics and economically relevant systems. Technical details
            about my work can be found in the Projects section of this portfolio.
          </p>

          <p>
            On a more personal note, I plan to add access to my blog in the future, where I will
            share reflections and interests beyond purely technical topics. A detailed overview
            of my academic background and experience can be found in my CV, available on this
            page. For any further questions, feel free to reach out through the Contact section.
